# Stock Price Checker
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;Stock price checker will scrap stock price data from a public website so that when given a stock tick symbol (e.g. “ISRG”, aka Intuitive Surgical) as the input, the application returns the stock’s high, low, open and close prices today. **If the market is not yet open, it will return yesterday's data.**
